1.What is Linear Regression?
 -> This algorithm is used to find the relationship between 2 variables(dependent and independent)
 -> It is a linear model which assumes a linear relationship between input and output variables
 -> If we have single input variable then we call it as simple linear regression,if we have multiple we call it as multiple linear regression.
 
 
 2.Goal of Linear Regression?
  -> The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data
  -> Equation of the line is Y=m*X+b where y=output,x=input and m&b are coefficients that we need to estimate
  
 3.How does it work?
   -> Ultimate goal is to find the best fit line which minimizes the error(distance between the line and the datapoint)
   -> The values of m and b must be choosen so that they minimize the error
   ->So the algorithm will try multiple m and b values and calculates the error
   -> finally it takes the best m and b which has low error
   
 4.Advabtages
  -> Linear Regression is simple to implement and easier to interpret the output coefficients.
  -> High Performance on linearly seperable datasets
  -> Linear Regression is susceptible to over-fitting but it can be avoided using some dimensionately reduction techniques,reguralization(l1 and L2) techniques and cross-validation
  
  
  
  5.Disadvantages
  -> Prone to underfitting
  -> Sensitive to outliers
  -> Linear Regression assumes that the data is independent
